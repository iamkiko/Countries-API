## [Data For Countries](https://iamkiko.github.io/Countries-API/) :earth_africa:

### An API To Find Basic Information on Countries :mag:

This project was one of the first on the Full Stack Open [curriculum](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2/getting_data_from_server#exercises), with the purpose of familiarizing ourselves with Axios and API calls, rendered using React.

Find the project hosted [here.](https://iamkiko.github.io/Countries-API/)

### APIs used :key:
- [Rest Countries API](https://github.com/apilayer/restcountries) and [official site](https://restcountries.eu/) for delivering the information about each country, upon search.
- [Weatherstack API](https://weatherstack.com/documentation) for the weather data. _They were kind enough to provide a free trial for 3 months, to allow https access for GitHub pages._


### Built with _(Tech Stack)_ :wrench:

- __React__ - The front end is powered by React for state management and dynamic rendering. It uses hooks such as useEffect to fetch data from the APIs & useState for internal state
- __Axios__ - HTTP requests to the APIs are returned using Axios promises and JSON data.
- __SCSS__ - Styling done with SCSS modules (basic)
